# GETTING CRACKED AT C

-   I am trying to take a different route to learning C; I've decided I was going to learn C as I have other languages; through actually doing.

-   I was in tutorial hell but I've made a conslusive decision. I refuse to not understand things deeply so I'm taking a different route:

*   1. I asked ChatGPT to make a list of projects from beginner to mastery; you can find that here [Project List](./Project%20List.md)
*   2. No tutorials, just use my brain
*   3. No AI, I can only use it for syntax related issues and for picking my brain.
