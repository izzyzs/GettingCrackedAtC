# GETTING CRACKED AT C

-   I am trying to take a different route to learning C; I've decided I was going to learn C as I have other languages; through actually doing.
-   I haven't gotten an internship im ny 4 years of college and now that I graduated, the fear of not getting hired is starting to settle. Instead of sitting around and being complacent, I want to develop my skills as a programmer so that I can one day play the role of an irreplaceable asset. And the first step of that is refusing to not understand things deeply so because of that I'm taking a different route to learning C:

    *   I asked ChatGPT to make a list of projects from beginner to mastery; you can the details below.
    *   No tutorials (for the project), just use my brain.
    *   No copying other implementations, I can only read what other's did for inspiration.
    *   No AI, I can only use it for syntax related issues and for picking apart my ideas.
